Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?

- What was your experience?
This was a refresh to CSS as I haven't used it in a while. Hoever, kniwd the basic is very helpful as well as having the design is a great advantage.
- What have you learned/improved?
At the beggining I didn't know how to start. I wanted to do it without any library but I got a useful solution but there ware sone gaps in the resposivity. Then I decided to use Bulma CSS just to try it as I had just used bootrap before.
- Your wisdom? :)
Always try the best and put attention to details.
